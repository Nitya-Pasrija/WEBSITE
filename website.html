        <h1>BENEFITS OF YOGA</h1>
        <P>Yoga offers physical and mental health benefits for people of all ages. And, if you’re going through an illness, recovering from surgery or living with a chronic condition, yoga can become an integral part of your treatment and potentially hasten healing. </P>

                <h3> Heart Health</h3>
                <P>Regular yoga practice may reduce levels of stress and body-wide inflammation, contributing to healthier hearts. Several of the factors contributing to heart disease, including high blood pressure and excess weight, can also be addressed through yoga.</P>

            <div class="blog-tab">
                <h3>Alleviates stress and anxiety</h3>
                <P>Yoga encourages mental and physical relaxation. Yoga poses may help you release physical blockages like muscle knots, helping release emotions and tension. They also promote the release of mood-boosting endorphins, which are the feel-good hormones that can positively affect how you handle stress.</P>

            <div class="blog-tab">
                <h3>Strength, balance and flexibility</h3>
                <P>Slow movements and deep breathing increase blood flow and warm up muscles, while holding a pose can build strength. Yoga is as good as basic stretching for easing pain and improving mobility in people with lower back pain.</P>

        <h1>NEW TO YOGA- WHERE TO START?</h1>
        <p>If you’re new to yoga, it’s good to sign up for a class so you can learn good form!!. Call local yoga studios, gyms, or senior centers and ask if they offer classes taught by a teacher trained to work with older people or those with physical limitations. A gentle yoga class can be a good choice. Chair (or seated) yoga is a great option if your mobility or balance is limited, according to us. Move at your own pace—and remember that any yoga pose can be modified so it’s right for you. Just ask your teacher.</p>

        <h1>TOP 3 YOGA POSES</h1>
        <p>Home practice is hard. It’s only human to go through phases where you get distracted by the shiny new challenge pose to try—or, on the opposite end of the spectrum, simply getting stuck in your favorite feel-good sequence. While you definitely don’t want to lose sight of goals or the sweet sensations that keep you coming back to your mat, it’s a good idea to take a critical eye to your practice now and then and look for the areas where you could strive for greater balance.</p>

                <h3>1. Salamba Setu Bandha Sarvangasana (Supported Bridge Pose)</h3>
                <p>This is my happy place. Funny enough, traditional Bridge Pose makes me crazy. Add a block under the lower back and voilà—I could stay there for hours with a smile on my face. This is a great modification for Shoulderstand and a relaxing way to release the front body and release the spine.</p>

                <h3>2. Janu Sirsasana (Head-to-Knee Forward Bend)</h3>
                <p>This one may seem random, but I have affection for it going all the way back to my Ashtanga days. This fabulous forward fold releases the calf and hamstring of the straight leg with the added benefit of opening the hip of the bent-knee leg. It also teaches the student to notice the effects of small nuances, such as squaring the chest with the straight-leg knee.</p>

                <h3>3. Crescent Lunge</h3>
                <p>I can’t imagine a yoga practice without this perfect standing pose. Crescent Lunge my go-to for opening my hips and psoas, encouraging space in my chest, and feeling powerful on my feet.</p>
